# imdb_ratings

This project is for me to look a little bit more at my imdb ratings. Eventually, I'd like to create a Plotly/Dash dashboard that summarizes the data just like in ethanfuerst/[spotifyinsights](https://github.com/ethanfuerst/spotifyinsights)

## Files in this repository

__*award_shows.py*__ - .py file where I did some exploratory analysis for award show season

__*ratings_analysis.py*__ - .py file that takes data from the ratings.csv and creates the visualizations

__*ratings.csv*__ - .csv file with my ratings data.

__*ratings_clean.csv*__ - .csv file connected to the .twb

__*rating_vis.twb*__ - Tableau workbook where I can plan out how I want to visualize the data

__*.gitignore*__ - shows github what files to ignore when I commit my changes.

## TODO

- [x] one hot encoding for genres
- [ ] Bin columns
- [ ] visualize my ratings in different ways
- [ ] look in to [APIs](http://www.omdbapi.com/)
- [ ] create ML model to predict my scores
