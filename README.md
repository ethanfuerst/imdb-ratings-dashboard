This project is for me to look a little bit more at my imdb ratings. Eventually, I'd like to create a Plotly/Dash dashboard that summarizes the data just like in ethanfuerst/[spotifyinsights](https://github.com/ethanfuerst/spotifyinsights)

**Files in this repository:**

*ratings_analysis.py* - .py file that takes data from the ratings.csv and creates the visualizations

*ratings.csv* - .csv file with my ratings data.

*rating_vis.twb* - Tableau workbook where I can plan out how I want to visualize the data

*.gitignore* - shows github what files to ignore when I commit my changes.

**TODO:**

- [ ] learn more about Plotly and Dash

- [ ] figure out how to clean all the data and what format I will use the dataframes for
