# imdb_ratings

This project is for me to look a little bit more at my imdb ratings. Eventually, I'd like to create a Plotly/Dash dashboard that summarizes the data just like in ethanfuerst/[spotifyinsights](https://github.com/ethanfuerst/spotifyinsights)

## Files in this repository by extension

### .csv

__*ratings.csv*__ - my ratings data from iMDB

### .py

__*award_shows.py*__ - exploratory analysis for award show season to see if you can predict oscar winners

__*ratings_analysis.py*__ - visualizations from ratings.csv

## TODO

- [x] one hot encoding for genres
- [ ] Ratings diff vs. year - add toggle by genre
- [ ] Bin columns
- [ ] visualize my ratings in different ways
- [ ] look in to [APIs](http://www.omdbapi.com/)
- [ ] create ML model to predict my scores
